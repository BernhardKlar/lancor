Description: Implementation of the methods described in Holzmann, Klar (2024) <doi: 10.1111/sjos.12733>.
    Lancaster correlation is a correlation coefficient which equals the 
    absolute value of the Pearson correlation for the bivariate normal distribution,
    and is equal to or slightly less than the maximum correlation coefficient 
    for a variety of bivariate distributions. Rank and moment-based estimators and 
    corresponding confidence intervals are implemented, as well as independence 
    tests based on these statistics.
